description: Commit and push current changes
---
Commit all current changes with a good commit message and push to the current branch.

Always append a `Co-Authored-By:` git trailer to the commit message using the name of the model you are currently running as. For example:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Use your actual model name (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.).
